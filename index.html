                <h2> Tip-Driven Ducted Rotor</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Open rotor and conventional ducted rotor propulsion systems are prone to inefficiencies at the blade tips as the high-pressure air at the bottom of the blade leak towards the low-pressure region at the top of the blade, forming a tip-vortex. 
                    These blade tip-vortices not only reduce the performance of the propulsion system as they deprive the rotor of thrust at the most critical part of the blade, but also lead to high aircraft noise emissions as the vortices interact with other parts of the airframe or even the following blade.
                    At MagLev Aero, we are working to resolve this issue by developing a tip-driven ducted rotor system that prevents the tip vortex formation. The CFD analysis I conducted using a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) solver shows <b>more than 20% improvement in performance</b> compared to a conventional ducted rotor.
                    The vorticity iso-surfaces for the two cases shown below is a visual testament to the enhancement in aerodynamic performance of the tip-driven propulsion system.

                <h2> Quadrotor Biplane Tailsitter</h2>
                <br>
                <p> During the final years of my PhD, I analyzed the Common Research Configuration (CRC) quadrotor biplane tailsitter model using the in-house hybrid RANS-LES CFD solver Mercury to investigate its performance and the noise footprint in hover and forward flight. The aircraft was developed in a collaborative effort 
                    between the University of Maryland and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory (ARL). This in-depth study revealed the intricacies of the rotor-airframe aerodynamic interaction and how it shapes the noise footprint of the aircraft. In an attempt to reduce the noise emissions of the
                    aircraft, we resorted to synchrophasing of the rotors (rotors having predetermined phase offsets between each other), which showed success especially in hover.

                <br>
                <p> 
                    Among the first projects I undertook at Maryland was the CFD and aeroacoustic analysis of a wingtip-mounted propeller geometry, provided by the 1st Workshop for Integrated Propeller Predictions (WIPP). Our CFD predictions using the in-house solver perfectly matched the wind tunnel test data and the study emphasized the significance
                     of the wing as an aircraft noise source when placed in the wake of a propeller. The noise footprint increases not only because of the interaction between the propeller wake and the wing but also due to the unsteadiness in the propeller blade loading caused by its interaction with the wing upwash. The noise foorptints given below shows 
                     how the wing is louder than the propeller when the porpeller axis is aligned with the freestream.

                <h2> Transient Aeroacoustic Solver</h2>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Aircraft noise footprints are usually analyzed for periodic maneuvers such as hover and forward flight, and therefore, the acoustic solvers are designed to with the assumption of periodicity in the sound pressure signals. However, in the eVTOL era of aviation, noise footprints of non-periodic aircraft maneuvers also need to be analyzed as they are expected to occur in dense urban environments.
                    To analyze such maneuvers, I developed a transient aeroacoustic solver (ACUM-3) using C++, CUDA, and MPI. The core computation was parallelied on GPU and parts of the time history was parallelized on multiple CPUs so that the computation can be run on an HPC to reduce the computation time. A new algorithm was developed to achieve the parallelization of the time dimension. The tool was used to analyze 
                    the transient noise footprint of a propeller transitioning from hover to forward flight.

                <p> 
                    At Maryland, I led the graduate student design team at the 38<sup>th</sup> Vertical Flight Society (VFS) Student Design Competition and we won first place for our tandem rotor aircraft, Alicorn. We were asked to design an unmanned VTOL aircraft with a payload capacity of 50 kg and a range of 200 km for a medical equipment distribution mission. 
                    Our team came up with a detailed engineering design amidst a Covid lockdown within a course of 15 weeks. I performed the aerodynamic design of the rotor system and the fuselage with a comprehensive CFD analysis that reduced the aircraft drag by 50%.

                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, I participated in the 3<sup>rd</sup> VFS Design-Build-Vertical Flight (DBVF) Competition, where we designed and built the quadrotor tailsitter aircraft, Horizon. I conducted the aerodynamic design of the wings and through CFD, I improved the aircraft performance by optimizing the winglets for high-speed flight. We took second place in the competition.

                <p>
                    I grew up in Sri Lanka, a beautiful island often called the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean." My love for math and science began at a young age and eventually led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering at the University of Peradeniya. 
                    During my time there, I discovered a passion for aerodynamics, particularly through my final-year research project on wind loads on tall buildings, guided by Prof. Kushan Wijesundara. Inspired by binge-watching Mayday: Air Crash Investigations, I developed a deep interest in aeronautics and decided to pursue higher studies in the United States.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2018, I joined the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Research Lab at the University of Maryland, where I was fortunate to work under the mentorship of Prof. James Baeder. 
                    After completing my PhD in 2023, I began my professional journey with Maglev Aero, a cutting-edge company developing electric propulsion systems powered by magnetic levitation.
