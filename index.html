                <h2> Tip-Driven Ducted Rotor</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Open rotor and conventional ducted rotor propulsion systems suffer from inefficiencies at the blade tips due to high-pressure air leaking from the bottom of the blade to the low-pressure region at the top, forming a tip vortex. 
                    These tip vortices reduce propulsion performance—depriving the rotor of thrust at the most critical part of the blade—and contribute to high aircraft noise emissions as they interact with other parts of the airframe or subsequent blades.
                    At MagLev Aero, we address this issue by developing a tip-driven ducted rotor system that prevents tip vortex formation. My CFD analysis, conducted using a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) solver, demonstrates <b> a more than 20% improvement in performance</b> compared to a conventional ducted rotor. 
                    The vorticity iso-surfaces for the two cases shown below visually illustrate the aerodynamic performance enhancement of the tip-driven propulsion system.

                <h2> Quadrotor Biplane Tailsitter</h2>
                <br>
                <p> During the final years of my PhD, I analyzed the Common Research Configuration (CRC) quadrotor biplane tailsitter model using the in-house hybrid RANS-LES CFD solver Mercury to assess its performance and the noise footprint in both hover and forward flight. 
                    Developed through a collaboration between the University of Maryland and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory (ARL), this aircraft provided a unique platform to study rotor-airframe aerodynamic interactions and their impact on noise generation. 
                    To mitigate noise emissions, we explored rotor synchrophasing—introducing predetermined phase offsets between rotors—which proved particularly effective in hover.

                <h2> Wingtip-Mounted Propeller</h2>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Among the first projects I undertook at Maryland was the CFD and aeroacoustic analysis of a wingtip-mounted propeller geometry, provided by the 1st Workshop for Integrated Propeller Predictions (WIPP). Our CFD predictions using the in-house solver perfectly matched the wind tunnel test data and the study highlighted the significance
                    of the wing as an aircraft noise source when placed in the wake of a propeller. The noise footprint increases not only due to the interaction between the propeller wake and the wing but also because of unsteady blade loading caused by the propeller’s interaction with the wing upwash. The noise footprints shown below illustrate that when the propeller axis is aligned with the freestream, 
                    the wing generates more noise than the propeller itself.

                <h2> Transient Aeroacoustic Solver</h2>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Aircraft noise footprints are typically analyzed for periodic maneuvers such as hover and forward flight, with acoustic solvers designed under the assumption of periodicity in sound pressure signals. However, in the eVTOL era, non-periodic maneuvers must also be considered, as they are expected to occur in dense urban environments. 
                    To address this, I developed a transient aeroacoustic solver (ACUM-3) using C++, CUDA, and MPI. The core computations were parallelized on GPUs, while segments of the time history were distributed across multiple CPUs, enabling efficient execution on HPC systems to reduce computation time. 
                    A novel algorithm was implemented to parallelize the time dimension, allowing for scalable and efficient processing. This tool was used to analyze the transient noise footprint of a propeller transitioning from hover to forward flight.

                <p> 
                    At Maryland, I led the graduate student design team in the 38<sup>th</sup> Vertical Flight Society (VFS) Student Design Competition, where we won first place for our tandem rotor aircraft, Alicorn. The challenge was to design an unmanned VTOL aircraft capable of carrying a 50 kg payload over a 200 km range for a medical equipment distribution mission. 
                    Despite the constraints of the COVID lockdown, our team developed a detailed engineering design within 15 weeks. I was responsible for the aerodynamic design of the rotor system and fuselage, conducting comprehensive CFD analyses that reduced aircraft drag by 50%.

                    <br><br>
                    I also participated in the 3<sup>rd</sup> VFS Design-Build-Vertical Flight (DBVF) Competition, where we designed and built the quadrotor tailsitter aircraft Horizon. I led the aerodynamic design of the wings and, through CFD optimization, enhanced aircraft performance by refining the winglets for high-speed flight. Our team secured second place in the competition. For more details,

                <p>
                    I grew up in Sri Lanka, a beautiful island often called the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean." My love for math and science began at a young age and eventually led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering at the University of Peradeniya. 
                    During my time there, I discovered a passion for aerodynamics, particularly through my final-year research project on wind loads on tall buildings, guided by Prof. Kushan Wijesundara. Inspired by binge-watching Mayday: Air Crash Investigations, I developed a deep interest in aeronautics and decided to pursue higher studies in the United States.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2018, I joined the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Research Lab at the University of Maryland, where I was fortunate to work under the mentorship of Prof. James Baeder. 
                    After completing my PhD in 2023, I began my professional journey with Maglev Aero, a cutting-edge company developing electric propulsion systems powered by magnetic levitation.
